# Website Restoration Instructions

This website has been temporarily replaced with an "Under Development" page.

## To restore the original website:

1. Replace the current index.html with the backup:
   ```bash
   mv index.original.html index.html
   ```

2. Remove this instruction file:
   ```bash
   rm RESTORE_INSTRUCTIONS.md
   ```

The original website content is preserved in `index.original.html` and all other assets (styles.css, script.js, Photo.jpg) remain unchanged.
